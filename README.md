## Ben Hurst

Having recently completed an intensive five-month software engineering bootcamp, I've significantly expanded my proficiency in Python, Javascript, Tailwind, React and Next.JS as well as TDD and CI/CD principles. I used these to build full stack applications with my peers using industry standard methodologies and practices such as Agile, Scrum, version control and designing using wireframes, flow charts and entity relationship diagrams.

This platform introduced a fresh perspective to audience engagement, utilising a new format for increased connection. It was a well praised initiative internally and externally across the policing landscape.
- Collaborated with clients to scope their projects, engaging with the immersive learning department to direct filming of training material within a state-of-the-art custody suite. This was to address the heightened demand for training, particularly [vulnerabilities in custody](https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/learning-lessons-42-custody#article3).
- Instrumental in the successful [launch of a company rebrand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fPBt3VGROs), creating dynamic motion graphics and video content. Aligned video content with brand messaging for a cohesive and impactful image. The video was played across multiple policing centres, websites and social media. This effort was coordinated with the launch of a new website and aimed to bolster trust in policing during a challenging period.

**The Bakery** (Jan 19 to Dec 19)  
_Digital Content Creator_

- Established content production and implemented best practices in both the UK and Brazil locations, to support outreach for new clients and maintain partnerships with existing ones.
- Demonstrated expertise in the end-to-end production process and effective use of digital platforms by leading the planning, recording, editing, and distribution of a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1BE5MDtSnhzx8W2DR3rTho) on mainstream platforms This served as a fresh platform to engage and share a new format of content.
- Planned, developed, and maintained social channels and campaigns, optimising digital content for maximum impact and engagement by using analytics, demonstrating a data-driven approach.

**Weston College** (Jan 18 to Nov 18)  
_Marketing Officer - Videographer / Photographer_

- Implemented a management system to streamline access to assets, including graphics, photos, videos, and brand guidelines. Used a python script to optimise uploading content to database. This eased and simplified access to assets company wide.
- Provided crucial support for [live events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59tYPHEVr18) by leading operations in lighting, sound, and data. Created engaging video content for displays, enhancing the overall event experience through seamless technical execution.

## Skills

#### Leadership and Project Management
Led the creation of two podcasts at two previous places of work, [The Bakery](https://open.spotify.com/show/1BE5MDtSnhzx8W2DR3rTho?si=86b47a8cb283453f) and [College of Policing](https://open.spotify.com/show/0iFjSyq9KAzGjuV2b0JnWx?si=2d7f430ddd11426e). This involved strategising the direction of future episodes, planning and setting up interviews, capturing the audio content, editing and distributing them to various platforms. This was an end to end process, where multiple episodes were being planned simultaneously at different stages. I also have experience in delegating video projects, providing support where needed and offering feedback. This shows my ability to lead and manage projects effectively, a skill that is vital in software development.

#### Client Liaison and Interpersonal Skills
I can communicate with clients to scope projects and am able to speak clearly both technically and non-technically to stakeholders and peers alike. I supported running a live interview with Cressida Dick, former head of the metropolitan police, with a number of technical crew members. During set up I would have to switch quickly between addressing Cressida in a formal but non-technical manner, to peers, colleagues and other members in a non-formal but technical manner. This makes me an effective communicator and understanding of client needs.

#### Creative Background
Having a creative background can make me a valuable asset in software development. My experience in supporting the launch of a rebrand, creating visual messaging and understanding of graphics and interfaces can transfer well into software.

#### Marketing Strategy and Analytics
Working in marketing has exposed me to creating strategies to response to shifting markets and understanding our audiences, curating content to fit changing needs. I have also leveraged analytics to optimise content for maximum engagement reflecting a data-driven approach.

#### Problem Solving and Adaptability
Overcoming challenges in filming environments, such as time constraints, highlights problem-solving skills. In software development, the ability to adapt and find solutions to unexpected issues during the development process is crucial.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (Sep 23 to Jan 24)
- Mastered the fundamentals of  Python, functional and object-oriented programming, test-driven development, pair programming and debugging.
- Led creation of a full-stack application using agile methodology. We used Flask, hashlib, and psycopg2 with version control, Git and GitHub as part of a collaborative team effort.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on a cloud-hosted relational database containing Stack Overflow data. I used Pandas dataframes and discovered an upwards trend of unanswered posts since launch. Illustrated findings through visually compelling graphs using matplotlib and seaborn demonstrating a keen eye for actionable insights.
- Established a robust batch processing pipeline using Apache Airflow for efficient data transfer and ETL operations. Applied boto3 and Athena to seamlessly load data into an analytical database.
- Used Terraform to setup and configure an EC2 instance on AWS. Gained exposure to cutting-edge technologies such as PySpark, Kafka, and crafted interactive dashboards using Voila and Dash.
- Learned the fundamentals of machine learning with SciKit-Learn and StatsModels, using simple and multiple linear regression, time series. I understand the principles of training, test and validation sets to train a model.

#### Bath Spa University (Sep 14 to Jun 15)
_Contemporary Arts and Professional Studies_
- 1:1 BA Honours
- Used Python scripts on Raspberry Pi devices to seamlessly display a dynamic mix of video content and processing a live video feed across multiple monitors, showcasing a hands-on approach to technology integration.
