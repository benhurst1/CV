## Skills

#### Leadership and Project Management
Led the creation of two podcasts at two previous places of work, [The Bakery](https://open.spotify.com/show/1BE5MDtSnhzx8W2DR3rTho?si=86b47a8cb283453f) and [College of Policing](https://open.spotify.com/show/0iFjSyq9KAzGjuV2b0JnWx?si=2d7f430ddd11426e). This involved strategising the direction of future episodes, planning and setting up interviews, capturing the audio content, editing and distributing them to various platforms. This was an end to end process, where multiple episodes were being planned simultaneously at different stages. I also have experience in delegating video projects, providing support where needed and offering feedback. This shows my ability to lead and manage projects effectively, a skill that is vital in software development.

#### Client Liaison and Interpersonal Skills
I can communicate with clients to scope projects and am able to speak clearly both technically and non-technically to stakeholders and peers alike. I supported running a live interview with Cressida Dick, former head of the metropolitan police, with a number of technical crew members. During set up I would have to switch quickly between addressing Cressida in a formal but non-technical manner, to peers, colleagues and other members in a non-formal but technical manner. This makes me an effective communicator and understanding of client needs.

#### Creative Background
Having a creative background can make me a valuable asset in software development. My experience in supporting the launch of a rebrand, creating visual messaging and understanding of graphics and interfaces can transfer well into software.

#### Marketing Strategy and Analytics
Working in marketing has exposed me to creating strategies to response to shifting markets and understanding our audiences, curating content to fit changing needs. I have also leveraged analytics to optimise content for maximum engagement reflecting a data-driven approach.

#### Problem Solving and Adaptability
Overcoming challenges in filming environments, such as time constraints, highlights problem-solving skills. In software development, the ability to adapt and find solutions to unexpected issues during the development process is crucial.
